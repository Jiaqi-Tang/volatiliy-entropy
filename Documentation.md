# Data Source

Raw data source: [HistData's MetaTrader EUR/USD 1-minute bar data](https://www.histdata.com/download-free-forex-historical-data/?/metatrader/1-minute-bar-quotes/EURUSD).

Local raw files are stored under `data/raw/metatrader`.

Asset: EUR/USD.

Raw frequency: 1-minute OHLC bars.

Raw files used: calendar years 2016 through 2025.

Observed cleaned timestamp range: 2016-01-03 22:00 UTC to 2025-12-31 21:57 UTC.

Raw fields: timestamp, open bid, high bid, low bid, close bid, volume.

## Raw Observations

Let the raw 1-minute price bars be indexed by observed timestamps:

$$
t \in \mathcal{T}_{1m}
$$

For each timestamp $t$, the raw observation contains:

$$
(O_t, H_t, L_t, C_t, V_t)
$$

The data source states that all timestamps use Eastern Standard Time without DST. This project
interprets raw timestamps as fixed UTC-05:00, with no daylight-saving adjustment.
All analysis timestamps are converted to UTC.

The raw files contain missing observations. Missingness is not repaired by
forward-filling or interpolation.

## Caveats

These are treated as vendor data artifacts.

**Zeros in Volume field**

The volume field $V_t$ is not used, as $V_t=0$ for all raw observations.

**Daylight saving time**

HistData's files are intended to be fixed EST, but from 2019 onward some files show
an EU daylight-saving-time transition artifact around 19:00 file time.

Observed issues:

- EU DST-end duplicate rows appear from 19:00 through 19:59 in 2019, 2020, 2021,
  2022, 2023, and 2025.
- These duplicate rows are exact duplicates, so they are removed by exact-row
  deduplication.
- EU DST-start has a missing 19:00 through 19:59 hour from 2019 onward.
- 2024 has the EU DST-start missing-hour pattern but does not have the corresponding
  EU DST-end duplicate-hour pattern.

# Preprocessing

Objective: Transform raw 1-minute EUR/USD OHLC data into a clean 5-minute log-return series suitable for volatility and entropy analysis.

## Data cleaning

**Load Raw Data**

Load all raw EUR/USD MetaTrader CSV files from 2016 through 2025.

The initial raw dataset is:

$$
\mathcal{X}_{1m}^{raw}
= \{(t_i, O_i, H_i, L_i, C_i, V_i)\}_{i=1}^{N_{raw}}
$$

**Timestamp Interpretation**

Each raw timestamp is converted to UTC:

$$
t_i^{UTC} = t_i^{raw} + 5\text{ hours}
$$

The preprocessing does not apply daylight-saving-time shifts.

**Exact Deduplication**

An exact duplicate means the full raw observation is repeated:

$$
(t_i, O_i, H_i, L_i, C_i, V_i)
=
(t_j, O_j, H_j, L_j, C_j, V_j)
$$

for $i \neq j$.

If duplicate timestamps with different OHLC or volume values are found, this is treated as a data-quality error (rather than choosing one observation arbitrarily). No such duplications were found.

The cleaned 1-minute dataset is:

$$
\mathcal{X}_{1m}^{clean}
=
\{(t_i, O_i, H_i, L_i, C_i, V_i)\}_{i=1}^{N_{1m}}
$$

where timestamps are in UTC.

## Data aggregations

**Aggregate to 5-Minute OHLC Bars**

Let $B_j$ be the set of observed 1-minute bars whose timestamps fall inside the
5-minute interval indexed by $j$.

For every nonempty 5-minute interval:

$$
|B_j| \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}
$$

the 5-minute OHLC bar is defined as:

$$
O_j^{5m} = \text{first observed } O_i \text{ in } B_j
$$

$$
H_j^{5m} = \max_{i \in B_j} H_i
$$

$$
L_j^{5m} = \min_{i \in B_j} L_i
$$

$$
C_j^{5m} = \text{last observed } C_i \text{ in } B_j
$$

The number of observed 1-minute bars used in each 5-minute bar is:

$$
n_j^{1m} = |B_j|
$$

Every nonempty 5-minute bar is kept, including bars constructed from only 1, 2, 3,
or 4 observed 1-minute bars. Empty 5-minute bars are dropped.

The resulting 5-minute OHLC dataset is:

$$
\mathcal{X}_{5m}
=
\{(t_j, O_j^{5m}, H_j^{5m}, L_j^{5m}, C_j^{5m}, n_j^{1m})\}_{j=1}^{N_{5m}}
$$

**Compute Log Returns**

Let the observed 5-minute close price be:

$$
S_j = C_j^{5m},\quad \text{ where } S_j > 0
$$

For consecutive observed 5-minute timestamps, compute:

$$
r_j = \log(S_j) - \log(S_{j-1})
$$

The elapsed time for each candidate return is:

$$
\Delta t_j = t_j - t_{j-1}
$$

**Gap Filtering**

The expected gap is:

$$
\Delta t_{expected} = 5\text{ minutes}
$$

The final clean return series keeps only returns satisfying:

$$
\Delta t_j = \Delta t_{expected} = 5\text{ minutes}
$$

This strict rule avoids including weekend gaps, holiday gaps, outages, and
missing-candle jumps as ordinary 5-minute returns.

The final clean return series is:

$$
R = \{r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_N\}
$$

of consecutive log returns on 5m data.

## Output datasets

Preprocessing outputs are intermediate datasets and can be found in the
`data/intermediate` folder:

```text
data/intermediate/eurusd_1m_utc_clean.csv
data/intermediate/eurusd_5m_ohlc_utc_nonempty.csv
data/intermediate/eurusd_5m_log_returns_clean.csv
data/intermediate/preprocessing_report.json
```

The clean 5-minute return dataset contains `timestamp_utc, close, log_return, previous_timestamp_utc, previous_close, delta_minutes, n_m1`, where `n_m1` records the number of observed 1-minute bars used to construct the current 5-minute close bar.

Dropped returns are not exported as a separate dataset. They are recorded only for
debugging and audit purposes in `data/intermediate/preprocessing_report.json`.

The final analysis dataset will be produced after length standardization and saved
as:

```text
data/final/eurusd_5m_log_returns_final.csv
```

# Length Standardization

Objective: truncate the dataset so its length is divisible by $2^K$, such that Block-Average Multi-Scale Decomposition can be done.

## Design choices

Choose maximum decomposition depth: $$K = 11$$

This gives block size of $2^K = 2048$.

Since the base return frequency is 5 minutes, the time span of one maximum-depth
block is:

$$
T_K = 5 \times 2^{11} = 10240\text{ minutes} \approx 7.11\text{ days}
$$

The standardized length is:

$$
N^* = \max \{2^K \cdot m : 2^K \cdot m \leq N\} = 2^K \left\lfloor \frac{N}{2^K} \right\rfloor
$$

With $K=11$ and $N=735,706$:

$$
N^* = 735{,}232
$$

The final analysis return series is:

$$
R^* = \{r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_{N^*}\}
$$

Rows are truncated from the end of the dataset only. The start of the sample is
preserved.

## Results

Rows dropped by truncation:

$$
N - N^* = 474
$$

Dropped tail timestamp range: `2025-12-30 06:30 UTC to 2025-12-31 21:55 UTC`

Final standardized timestamp range: `2016-01-03 22:05 UTC to 2025-12-30 06:25 UTC`

The standardized final dataset is saved as: `data/final/eurusd_5m_log_returns_final.csv`

The truncation report is saved as: `data/final/truncation_report.json`

For $R^*$:

# Baseline Series

Objective: Create baseline time series such that entropy can be interpreted against a baseline entropy.

## Design choices

Baseline series are generated from the standardized final return series $R^*$.

All baseline series have length $|R^{baseline}| = N^*$, and use the same timestamp index as $R^*$.

The timestamps are retained as alignment metadata; the baseline computations are conducted on ordered return index:

$$
i = 1,2,\ldots,N^*
$$

## Shuffled Baseline

The shuffled baseline is a random permutation of the standardized returns:

$$
R^{shuffle} = \pi(R^*)
$$

where $\pi$ is a random permutation.

Random seed: $137$

Properties preserved:

- same empirical distribution as $R^*$
- same mean and variance as $R^*$
- same minimum and maximum as $R^*$

Property destroyed:

- temporal ordering

Output:

```text
data/baselines/eurusd_5m_log_returns_shuffle.csv
```

## Brownian / Gaussian Baseline

The Gaussian baseline is generated as:

$$
R^{BM}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_R^2)
$$

where:

$$
\sigma_R^2 = Var(R^*)
$$

The variance is the population variance of the standardized final return series:

$$
\sigma_R^2
=
\frac{1}{N^*}\sum_{i=1}^{N^*}(r_i - \bar{r})^2
$$

where $\sigma_R^2 = 8.257150232019612 \times 10^{-8}$

Random seed: $271$

Properties targeted:

- same population variance as $R^*$
- Gaussian independent increments
- zero mean

Output:

```text
data/baselines/eurusd_5m_log_returns_gaussian.csv
```

The baseline report is saved as:

```text
data/baselines/baselines_report.json
```

## Results

Shuffled baseline:

```text

# Block-Average Multi-Scale Decomposition

Objective: Decompose the final return series and baseline series into scale-indexed
detail layers and a final approximation layer.

## Design choices

The decomposition is applied to:

$$
R^*,\quad R^{shuffle},\quad R^{BM}
$$

For each scale:

$$
k = 1,2,\ldots,K \quad \text{ with }\,K = 11
$$

the block size is:

$$
B_k = 2^k
$$

For each series:

$$
A_0 = R
$$

where $R$ denotes the input series being decomposed.

The approximation layer $A_k$ is defined as the block-mean approximation of the
original input series over consecutive non-overlapping blocks of size $B_k$.

For each block:

$$
\mu_j^{(k)} = \frac{1}{B_k}\sum_{i \in block_j} A_{0,i}
$$

The block mean is expanded back across its block, so $A_k$ has the same length as
the original series.

The detail layer is:

$$
D_k = A_{k-1} - A_k
$$

The reconstruction identity is:

$$
R = A_K + \sum_{k=1}^{K}D_k
$$

The saved decomposition columns are:

```text
index
timestamp_utc
original
D_01
...
D_11
A_11
```

Only $D_1,\ldots,D_{11}$, $A_{11}$, and the original series are saved. Intermediate
approximation layers $A_1,\ldots,A_{10}$ are computed internally but not exported.

The decomposition outputs are:

```text
data/decomposition/final_decomposition.csv
data/decomposition/shuffle_decomposition.csv
data/decomposition/gaussian_decomposition.csv
data/decomposition/decomposition_report.json
```

## Validation

For each decomposed series, reconstruction error is computed as:

$$
\epsilon_i = original_i - \left(A_{11,i} + \sum_{k=1}^{11}D_{k,i}\right)
$$

The decomposition fails if:

$$
\max_i |\epsilon_i| > 10^{-12}
$$

All three decompositions reconstruct to machine precision.
